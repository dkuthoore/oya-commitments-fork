This commitment should use whatever WETH is available in the Safe at the moment of execution.

Token addresses for this commitment are as follows: WETH is 0xfff9976782d46cc05630d1f6ebab18b2324d6b14, USDC is 0x1c7d4b196cb0c7b01d743fbc6116a902379c7238, and UNI is 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984.

If WETH/USDC is greater than or equal to 1800 and this is the first trigger that becomes true, swap all available WETH for USDC. For this WETH-to-USDC branch, use Uniswap V3 pool 0x6418eec70f50913ff0d756b48d32ce7c02b47c47.

If UNI/WETH is less than or equal to 0.03 and this is the first trigger that becomes true, swap all available WETH for UNI. For this WETH-to-UNI branch, use Uniswap V3 pool 0x287b0e934ed0439e2a7b1d5f0fc25ea2c24b64f7.

Only one branch may execute in total. First trigger wins. Enforce max slippage of 0.50%. If no valid route meets slippage and liquidity constraints, do not trade.
