This commitment should use whatever WETH is available in the Safe at the moment of execution.

Token addresses for this commitment are as follows: WETH is 0x7b79995e5f793A07Bc00c21412e50Ecae098E7f9, USDC is 0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238, and UNI is 0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984.

If WETH/USDC is greater than or equal to 1800 and this is the first trigger that becomes true, swap all available WETH for USDC. For this WETH-to-USDC branch, use Uniswap V3 pool 0x6418eec70f50913ff0d756b48d32ce7c02b47c47.

If UNI/WETH is less than or equal to 0.03 and this is the first trigger that becomes true, swap all available WETH for UNI. For this WETH-to-UNI branch, use Uniswap V3 pool 0x287b0e934ed0439e2a7b1d5f0fc25ea2c24b64f7.

Only one branch may execute in total. First trigger wins. Enforce max slippage of 0.50%. If no valid route meets slippage and liquidity constraints, do not trade.
