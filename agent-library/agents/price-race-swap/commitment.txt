This commitment should use whatever USDC is available in the Safe at the moment of execution.

Token addresses for this commitment are as follows: USDC is 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48, WETH is 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0E5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, and UNI is 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984.

If WETH/USDC is greater than or equal to 3200 and this is the first trigger that becomes true, buy WETH using all available USDC. For this WETH branch, use Uniswap V3 pool 0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8.

If UNI/USDC is less than or equal to 6.00 and this is the first trigger that becomes true, buy UNI using all available USDC. For this UNI branch, use a high-liquidity Uniswap pool.

Only one branch may execute in total. First trigger wins. Enforce max slippage of 0.50%. If no valid route meets slippage and liquidity constraints, do not trade.
